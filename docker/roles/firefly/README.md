## Creating the configuration file for auto import

To create the configuration file, the Data Import Tool can be used: [https://data-importer.firefly-iii.org/token](https://data-importer.firefly-iii.org/token).

This file needs then to be uploaded to the server and the import.sh needs to be changed accordingly.
